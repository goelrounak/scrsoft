      <h3>OUR SUPPORT</h3>
      <p>SCR Soft Technologies Software endeavours to provide the highest levels of customer support and service. We use our own products in providing our support, so it is in our best interests to show that these products are up to the challenge.</p>
      <p>This Maintenance and Support policy applies to existing SCR Soft Technologies Software customers who have purchased and paid for one or more of our products.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>1. GENERAL POLICIES.</h3>
      <p>Priority is given to our customers on maintenance. Telephone support is free for the first 30 days after the initial sale, in order to help you get up and running smoothly. After that, priority is given to those calls logged through our online help desk system (first preference) and via email to support@scrsoft.com. SCR Soft Technologies reserves the right to limit each telephone call to half an hour and to limit each call to one incident, which is defined as a single support issue or question. SCR Soft Technologies may also limit or terminate support service to a customer who uses the service in an irregular, excessive, abusive or fraudulent manner. Terms, conditions, support features, procedures, pricing and support availability are subject to change at any time without notice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>2. SERVICE AVAILABILITY</h3>
      <p>Support is limited to 12 months from the date of purchase of your first SCR Soft Technologies product or the start of your SCR Soft Technologies Annual Maintenance contract. Service availability may occasionally deviate from stated hours due to downtime for systems and server maintenance and observed INDIAN public holidays. SCR Soft Technologies cannot guarantee that you will not experience some delay in having one of our technical support consultants answer your query â€“ as call volumes fluctuate so too will response time.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="container">
     <h3>3. SUPPORT TOPIC LIMITATIONS.</h3>
     <p>Inquiries are limited to the following SCR Soft Technologies product areas: installation, upgrade assistance, basic usability and basic functionality, as described in product documentation or online help. SCR Soft Technologies does not claim to resolve connectivity issues caused by third-party services, service providers, operating systems, hardware or other software, or networking problems. The determination of the nature of your query for these purposes will be made by our technical support consultants.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h3>4. UPDATES AND UPGRADES.</h3>
    <p>Your Annual Maintenance agreement entitles you to any updates without charge, if such updates become available during the term of your subscription. SCR Soft Technologies does not warrant that there will be any updates to the SCR Soft Technologies software during the maintenance term. Upgrades to the latest version are not included under annual maintenance and are chargeable (at a reduced price). The only exception to this is for new customers, which will receive any upgrades free, that occur within 6 months of their purchase date. Any updates and/or upgrades will be available for download from our website only.</p>
